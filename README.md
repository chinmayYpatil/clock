# Clock Animation App

## Overview

Welcome to the Clock Animation App! This project demonstrates a simple clock animation using Kotlin and Jetpack Compose. The animation showcases a clock with moving hour, minute, and second hands to simulate the passage of time.

## Features

- **Clock Animation:** Displays a live clock with animated hour, minute, and second hands.
- **Jetpack Compose:** Utilizes Jetpack Compose for building the UI and animations.
- **Kotlin:** Developed using Kotlin programming language.

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/chinmayYpatil/clock.git
   ```
2. **Open the Project:**
   Open the project in Android Studio.

3. **Sync Gradle:**
   Make sure to sync the Gradle files to download the necessary dependencies.

4. **Run the App:**
   You can now run the app on an emulator or a physical Android device.

## How It Works

The app features a `ClockView` composable that handles the drawing and animation of the clock hands. The animation updates every second to reflect the current time.

### Main Components

- **`ClockView` Composable:** Main composable responsible for displaying the clock and animating the hands.
- **`ClockViewModel` Class:** Manages the time and provides updates to the `ClockView`.
